The first step is to create a Mongodb database with some spatial data. For this example, we will use the Australian suburbs layer available on the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.003July%202011).

It took me a bit of time to figure out the right format in import for Mongo. It is actually the `Features` part of a GeoJson:

~~~ json
[
  {"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[...]},"properties":{...}},
  {"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[...]},"properties":{...}},
  {"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[...]},"properties":{...}}
]
~~~

Geometries have to be on 2 dimensions (no z or altitude).

Once your certain that your data is in the right format, you can launch the following command which will import each geojson object into the database.

~~~ shell
mongoimport --db geodb path/to/file.geojson --collection suburbs â€“-jsonArray
~~~

The next step is to create a spatial index on the field containing the geometry in our new collection.

~~~ shell
mongo
> use geodb
> db.suburbs.ensureIndex({geometry:'2dsphere'})
~~~
